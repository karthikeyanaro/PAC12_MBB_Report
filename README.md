## Finding Data
**Data Set 1: "2017 NCAA Tournament Team Ratings"**

**Data Set 2: "March Madness 2018"**

**Data Set 4: "NCAA BigData"**

- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
> The data was downloaded from [data.world](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/march-madness-2017/workspace/file?filename=2017+NCAA+Tournament+team+ratings+-+Sheet1.csv) from searching for March Madness data sets online. (Data set 1)

> I downloaded it from [data world](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/march-madness-2018). (Data set 2)

> The data was downloaded from [data.world](https://data.world/michaelaroy/ncaa-tournament-results/workspace/file?filename=Big_Dance_CSV.csv). (Data set 4)

- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
> The data was generated from a seperate website, [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-march-madness-predictions/), that generates college basketball predictions based on rankings and past success. (Data set 1)

> The data was generated from an algorithm from mostly computer ratings which include: BPI, Elo, Pomeroy, LRMC, Sagarin, and Moore ratings. Then combined with those ratings, and input of human rankings produced by the NCAA, together they create "Combined pre-tournament rating". With adjustments like injuries, bonus from tournament wins, and travel a final probability rating is created. (Data set 2)

> The data was collected by combining multipe data sets by a data world user. The data is about the points scored by each team in games from 1980 all the way to current day. (Data set 4) 

- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
> there are 68 rows, each representing a team participating in the tournament. (Data set 1)

> 600, each representing teams in the tournament sorted by date. (Data set 2)

> There are 2200 rows, each representing a game played between two teams. (Data set 4)

- How many features (columns) are in the data?
> There are 7 columns, each representing different ratings and probabilities. (Data set 1)

> 16, each representing win probability for each round, gender, seeding, etc. (Data set 2)

> There are 10 columns, each representing year, round, region number, region name, scores, team names, and seeds.

- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
> I wonder what the best team from each region is? What team has the best composite rating? (Data set 1)

> We can predict that Villanova or any of the higher seeded teams have a higher chance of winning. (Data set 2)

> We can predict the chances of a team winning in their corresponding region. (Data set 4)

**Data Set 3: "2018 Individual Player Stats"**
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
> https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pt08h91kszrdypj/AAAjpOoNLq0WW9W-22gPpoXGa?preview=2018+Individual+Player+Stats.xlsx. 

> Found the url after scrolling through google results from search query, "2018 NCAA datasets"

- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
> There is no information available about who collected the data or how it was collected. I am assuming it was scraped from the NCAA
> website as there is publicly hosted information availble on their website but just not in a format available to download.

- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
> 4739 rows listing every single player in the NCAA.

- How many features (columns) are in the data?
> 26 cols with player names, school, position, minutes played, and other general player statistics.

- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
> Is there a corrolation between specific player or game statistics and were they finish in March Madness?
